# Horde alert, Survivor!
There's been a sudden abundance of Zombies all over the place. Screamers are now popping up in major towns, and we're finding sleepers on the road. Stay safe out there.

# Features
* Improved hordes
  * Customizable hordes that scale in size and difficulty, with gamestage & biome progression, to keep the game feeling balanced.
* World roaming hordes
  * Hordes are now commonplace, you'll encounter many on your journey.
  * Each major POI zone (i.e. cities) has hordes moving in and out constantly, while screamers patrol the zone.
  * You will also find smaller roaming hordes in the wilderness. They may either be lost, or making their way to a city.
* World Event System
  * Heatmap-like system that attracts nearby hordes depending on heatmap activities occurring in certain areas. The number and size of the hordes depend on where the activities are occurring. Near a city? Expect huge hordes to wander around and find out what's going on in the neighborhood.
  * Screamers contribute a lot of heat if they spot you nearby, attracting hordes nearby. Make sure to take them down quick or you'll be having many hordes knocking on your door.
* Enhanced AI behaviors
  * Hordes investigate interruptions to their current task as Zombies are a curious bunch.
  * Hordes can also merge and split in size, depending on their goals as a collective.
