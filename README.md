# Horde alert, Survivor!
The hordes we've been getting recently seem to be... different. The old scouts seem to have returned alongside the screamer, and the wandering hordes have been acting smarter-than-usual. The animals seem to have also been affected... what's going on?

Note: This mod can be added to existing saves to start working, no new save is required. Testing has been done on removing the mod from an existing save game, and no issues have currently been uncovered.

# Installation
**Note:** Do not download the whole repository and attempt to install the ImprovedHordes folder from the dev branch, as it will not work due to no compiled DLL being present. Follow the installation instructions below.

## For Clients
Download and extract the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/FilUnderscore/ImprovedHordes/releases) page, then just drag and drop the ImprovedHordes folder into the `Mods` folder in your 7 Days to Die install folder. Settings can be modified in the `Config/ImprovedHordes/settings.xml` file in the mod's folder.

## For dedicated servers
The mod only needs to be installed on the server, as it is a server-side mod, so any client that joins your server without the mod installed will be able to experience it. The installation instructions are the same as for clients, however it is installed in the `Mods` folder of the dedicated server.
