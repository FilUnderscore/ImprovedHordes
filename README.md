# Horde alert, Survivor!
The hordes we've been getting recently seem to be... different. The old scouts seem to have returned alongside the screamer, and the wandering hordes have been acting smarter-than-usual. The animals seem to have also been affected... what's going on?

Note: This mod can be added to existing saves to start working, no new save is required. Testing has been done on removing the mod from an existing save game, and no issues have currently been uncovered. However, always keep a copy of your save, in case something unexpected goes wrong.
