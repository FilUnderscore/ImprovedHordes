# Mod Manager
Manage your mods smarter by having an in-game tool to help manage all your Mod Settings and Updates through one interface, the Mods menu.

# Installation
**Note:** Do not download the whole repository and attempt to install the 000-ModManager folder from the dev branch, as it will not work due to no compiled DLL being present. Follow the installation instructions below.

## For Clients
Download and extract the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/FilUnderscore/ModManager/releases) page, then just drag and drop the 000-ModManager folder into the `Mods` folder in your 7 Days to Die install folder. Settings can be modified in the Mod Manager Settings Tab in the Mods menu.
